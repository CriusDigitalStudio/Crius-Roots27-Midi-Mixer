# Crius-Roots27-Midi-Mixer
This is a USB MIDI controller that consists of 27 linear Potentiometers and can be used as a MIDI Mixer for your DAW.
To connect all the 27 Potentiometers with the Arduino Pro Micro , I used the HC4067 Analog multiplexer.
You can edit the code and hook up , up to 32 Potentiometers with th 2 x HC4067 multiplexers.

Here I connected all the Ground Pins together and also all the 5V Pins together so the circuit uses less cables on the breadboard.
